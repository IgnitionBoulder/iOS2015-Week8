# Spark iOS 2015 Week 8
Repository for the eighth week of Fall 2015 Spark iOS curriculum and assignments

## Homework

Continue working on your final project. **We will continue to have lectures and you are still expected to attend class.** Lectures will be shortened to leave extra time for project help from the teachers.

### Timeline
* November 12
	* Present an app idea. This should take no longer than 2 minutes per person.
	* After the presentations, you can optionally form a group with 1 other person.
* *November 17*
	* Have your initial app repo created. Make sure to include a __.gitignore__ file to minimize cruft that is stored in the repo.
	* Be able to describe to one of the teachers the screens, layout and flow of your app. This doesn't need to be perfect, but put some thought into how your app will actually work, beyond just the idea phase.
* December 1
	* Have a working prototype of your app ready to demo to a teacher
	* Spend the next week polishing and fixing bugs
* December 8
	* Have a completed app ready
	* Final bug fixes and tweaks
* December 10
	* Last day of class
	* Present a 5-10 minute demo of your app
